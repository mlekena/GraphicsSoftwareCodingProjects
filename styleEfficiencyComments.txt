Overall comments on style, efficiency, Java conventions etc.

A few points to consider though for Program 3 and more:

1) Always follow the Java conventions which include the following:

   All class names should start with an uppercase letter.
   All variable names should start with a lowercase letter.
   All method names should start with a lowercase letter.

   Any class name, variable name or method name that is more than one word
   should have each internal word capitalized.
    e.g. for a class name:  EmployeeInformation
         for a variable name: employeeName
         for a method name: drawBigPixel

2) Efficiency

   For program 3 you will need to generate the Nper matrix and other 
   matrices.  The creation of the matrix should only occur when the
   information (VRP, Vup, etc.) that it depends on changes.  e.g. the
   Nper matrix should be created once at the beginning of the program
   after reading in the .view file.  Then only recreate it if any of
   the viewing parameters change.

   Also, it would make sense to only recompute the screen points 
   based on the original vertices once when the Nper matrix changes.
   
   Remember that the display method is called many times per second
   and there's no need to have it recompute the Nper matrix everytime,
   nor does it need to recompute the screen points from the original
   vertices every time display is called.


3) Do not depend on always having 10 vertices or some specific number
   of polygons.  Same with the viewing parameters --- don't assume
   any of the viewing parameters will be some specific value.
